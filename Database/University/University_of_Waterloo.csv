Common questions about the program

What is the difference between Architectural Engineering and Architecture?
The Architectural Engineering program is an accredited engineering program, so you’ll be able to work towards professional engineer (P.Eng.) status. Course content-wise, the program is actually closer to Civil Engineering than Architecture. Courses will cover content on mechanics, structural analysis and structural design, as well as heavy math content in the first two years. You'll have a better understanding of the science and engineering behind good building design – not just the structural aspects, but also energy efficiency, sustainable building design and smart/green building design. Architectural Engineering covers enough about the aesthetic aspects of building design to be able to communicate comfortably with architects on this subject. In Architecture, these aesthetic aspects are a much greater focus.
What is the difference between Architectural Engineering and Civil Engineering?
Architectural Engineering focuses heavily on building design. In contrast, Civil Engineering is a more general field with more breadth. The Civil Engineering curriculum includes design of large municipal infrastructure components. In both programs, you’ll take courses in structural analysis and design (i.e., how to determine forces in structures and size their members, connections, etc.). As an Architectural Engineering student, you’ll also take courses on building science and systems (such as HVAC) in the place of courses that Civil Engineering students take on transportation networks, water distribution systems, geotechnical engineering, and more.
Architectural engineers work for design consulting firms specializing in the design, construction, renovation, and rehabilitation of buildings. Civil engineers are more likely to get jobs with government, provincial highway authorities, and construction companies. There is certainly some overlap between these programs. However, the Architectural Engineering program has been developed to address highly specified issues particular to building construction.
Does the level of design work vary between Architectural Engineering, Architecture, and Civil Engineering?
Design has a very different meaning to engineers than it does to architects. There is not more or less in one program or the other – just different kinds of design. In comparison to Civil Engineering, Architectural Engineering is a studio-based program and introduces design concepts from day one. It can be said that the design in Architectural Engineering includes making decisions in addition to making calculations. This decision-making component is unique to the program and helps you address open-ended design problems.
How is the learning style different between the programs?
The main differences between Civil and Architectural Engineering in terms of learning style are the studio streams in Architectural Engineering. You’ll take a “studio” course every term, which will involve projects, model building, and synthesis of knowledge from other courses. In each studio you’ll work as part of a group on projects that rely on presentation of the work on a regular basis. You’ll have a desk in a studio space, which will be your home for the entire term. This is similar to what Architecture students currently have. You'll also do your third year at the School of Architecture in Cambridge, where you’ll interact and eventually work on collaborative projects with Architecture students. In other respects, the program is very much an engineering undergraduate program. It is different from Architecture in all the same ways as any other engineering program.
What would make me more suited to Architectural Engineering than Architecture?
If you’re strong in math and science, interested in the technical aspects of building performance and design, but lenient on artistic and creative outcomes, you would potentially be more suited for Architectural Engineering.
What would make me more suited to Architectural Engineering than Civil Engineering?
The skills required from you in these two programs would actually be similar. We expect it would primarily be interest and future career preferences which would drive you in one direction or the other. In both cases, we hope you'll choose Waterloo if you have a passion for the program and field of expertise to which you’re admitted.
How does the application process differ?
If you’re applying to Architectural Engineering or Civil Engineering, you’ll need to take high school chemistry. Architecture does not have this requirement. Architecture requires an interview and portfolio of creative work while Architectural Engineering and Civil Engineering don’t.  If you apply to Architectural Engineering or Civil Engineering, you’ll have the opportunity to complete an optional online interview.  Evidence of design and creative skills and interests will be considered an asset in Architectural Engineering much more than it would be in Civil Engineering.


""Being a part of a tight-knit class is amazing. There are about 80 people in my class, so everyone knows each other. I liked how if you had a homework question and went to the studio, someone would be able to help you with it.""Nimisha, second-year Architectural Engineering co-op studentAdmission requirements

Bachelor of Arts,https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/bachelor-of-arts,"

Want the flexibility to study several subjects? Thinking of pursuing further education as law, education, business, or a master's degree? A Bachelor of Arts degree may be the perfect fit for you.
You'll gain expertise in your chosen major as well as a breadth of knowledge in many subjects – and learn to apply age-old knowledge to today’s most important problems. It’s also the best way to become a free thinker and life-long learner.
What is a BA degree?
A Bachelor of Arts (BA) is a university degree that focuses on subjects within the liberal arts, humanities, social sciences, languages and culture, and fine arts. A bachelor’s degree is usually the first degree you would earn at university upon completing high school and normally takes three to four years to complete. Many programs give you the flexibility to choose many of your courses to suit your interests.
It's one of the most frequently-awarded degrees. Similar degrees include Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Mathematics (BMath), and Bachelor of Environmental Studies (BES).
What do you study in a Bachelor of Arts (BA)?

Many BA programs are very flexible, allowing you to study a range of subjects (such as psychology, English, or economics) or to really focus on one or two subjects.
You’ll normally have a ""major"" or main subject of interest. A large portion of your courses will be in that subject, but you’ll have the freedom to take courses in other subjects that help you build important skills like thinking critically and conducting research.


If you have several subjects you’re passionate about, many programs allow you to choose two majors (a double major) and/or a minor – a subject requiring less courses than a major that still allows you to demonstrate a strong level of knowledge in that subject.
If it sounds overwhelming, don't worry! You'll have an advisor who can help you select your courses and any minors or specializations you'd like to pursue.

At university, the range of science courses is amazing... well beyond what you're taught in high school. It branches into so many fascinating and challenging avenues...

What can you do with a science degree?
That's the question, isn't it? Studying at college or university is one of the biggest investments of your life. You'll invest a significant of time, money, and energy into your degree, so you want to know you're picking the one's that's best for you; one you can use in the future. If your passion for science – whether it be biology, chemistry, physics, or life sciences – has gotten you here, then you've definitely already invested some time into considering it.

Pick a skill, any skill
The anatomy-observing, formula-wielding, and deductive-reasoning skills in your repertoire will work alongside the numerous other skills you’ll gain. These skills – perfectly suited for careers such as medical practitioner, chemist, astrophysicist, veterinarian, or environmental consultant – are also transferable to careers in other fields, such as business or education.
Technical skills, like data analysis, experimentation, and project management that you learn in class and the lab will perfectly suit you for careers in research, academia, and government.
Soft skills, like communications, time management, and adaptability, are vital in any career.
What you learn in a science degree can be applied to a lot more of life than just the kind that fits under a microscope.


A career path that's unique to you
Science drives – and is driven by – human curiosity as we attempt to understand everything from our bodies to our environment.
We look to the stars and deep within ourselves – developing new ideas, disrupting industries, and revolutionizing daily life with new technology and methods that will impact lives for generations.
And no path is set in stone. A graduate of biology, for instance, may conduct research in a hospital while another becomes a fisheries technician for the government.
Learn about the future of careers in the natural, physical, and life sciences.

 
So, what can you do with a Bachelor of Science? Well, that's up to you.
What we can promise you is you'll start a reaction, one that propels you forward towards your dreams. With this solid yet diverse degree, you've got the perfect foundation to discover that new chemical, conduct that life-changing research, get that medical school admission, create that essential business, or consult in that innovating lab.

A Bachelor of Science is more than just learning in lectures – it's all about discovery and research through experimentation.


Is a Bachelor of Science a good degree?
Considering some of the most influential and intelligent people on the planet hold (or have held) a BSc degree, we can say with confidence it is a ""good"" degree. The skills you obtain prepare you for some of the most respected positions in our society, such as doctors, nurses, and scientists.
However, a degree is what you make of it. Simply graduating doesn't facilitate a successful future. Your degree will open doors, but you need to take the steps to get through them – and this often means boosting your resume with volunteer or job experience in the area you are seeking.


What do you do in a BSc?
A Science program is more than just learning in lectures – it's all about discovery and research through experimentation.
A BSc can be more hands-on than many other degrees, giving you access to lots of labs, field work, exchanges, and opportunities to complete your own research project – providing even more depth to your degree.

 

At Waterloo, many of our programs include a term- or year-long research project that you get to design and control – from the topic to the execution – which prepares you for a career in the sciences or for further studies in graduate school.
What is first year like?
Your first year in a science program is a bit different from university to university. Some programs have a general first year where everyone takes the same required classes, using elective courses to explore possible majors for second year. Other programs will have you start your major in first year, giving you maximum exposure to the science you want to learn most. Both types of programs have pros and cons and you have to decide which works best for you.
At Waterloo, you can also expect to take five courses with one or two associated labs in each term of your two terms. Labs can definitely add to the complexity of your time in university, but students who graduate with a Bachelor of Science note how much more prepared they are for the work force considering they have developed strong time management skills and have had more opportunities to participate in hands-on learning.
Common questions
What is an Honours Bachelor of Science?
An honours degree requires more courses (typically five courses per term, with two terms per year, for four years) and a higher grade point average (GPA) than a general degree, which takes about three years to complete. However, a general degree may be your goal if you intend to leave your undergraduate university early to attend a professional school, such as medical school.

What science programs does Waterloo offer?
At Waterloo, we offer 20 science majors (within the Faculty of Science, the Faculty of Health, and the Faculty of Environment) and two professional programs: Doctor of Optometry (OD) and Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD).


What high school classes are needed?
You'll usually need high school courses in math, English, and at least one of the core sciences, although requirements vary from university to university. At Waterloo, admission requirements differ from major to major so be sure to review them well before you apply.

 

How long is a BSc program?
Most bachelor's degrees take three or four years to complete as a full-time student, based upon on whether you earn a general degree or an honours degree.
It's possible, depending on the institution you attend, to earn your degree online while working, which can take longer if you take only one or two courses a term.


What is a Bachelor of Applied Science?
At Waterloo, students graduating from the Faculty of Engineering receive a Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in their major, e.g., Biomedical Engineering, Civil Engineering, etc.
Students graduating from the Faculty of Science receive a Bachelor of Science degree.

Common questions about the program

What is the difference between Biology, Biomedical Sciences, and Biochemistry?
Biology starts with a broad foundation in all aspects of the major. After first year, you can then use your many elective courses to focus on a specific aspect of biology such as plants, animals, or microbiology. Biomedical Sciences also starts off with a fairly general first year but keeps a focus on human and animal biology. It also includes more chemistry and physics than Biology so that your science knowledge is a bit broader if you're interested in attending medical school, etc. Biochemistry studies the chemical reactions in living systems so your courses will be about 60% chemistry with some biology and physics.
How much of the program is biology and how much is chemistry?
Biochemistry is a combination of the two subjects; however the focus is on applying chemistry and chemical properties to biological systems.
Does Biochemistry prepare you to apply to medical school?
Yes and no. Biochemistry will prepare you to apply to medical school, as most medical schools in Canada don't have specific prerequisite courses. However, having a higher proportion of lab courses and required courses makes it tricky to make room for additional subjects (electives) that you'll need to take the MCAT and use as course requirements to get into med school. So yes, you can get into medical school, but it's definitely not the most easy or straightforward route. View tips on how to get into medical school.



What can you do with a Biochemistry degree?

Graduates commonly pursue careers with pharmaceutical companies, labs, hospitals and health-related research institutes, agricultural companies, toxicology and in education, research, biotechnology, and more.

What’s the difference between Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Engineering?

Biomedical Sciences is the study of life from a medical perspective. You’ll learn about the body, disease, healing processes, genetics, physiology – the knowledge of how the body works and responds to stimuli.
Biomedical Engineering is the application of that scientific knowledge to develop medical technology. For instance, a surgeon needs to understand biomedical science to operate on a patient – and might use laser-guided surgical devices, artificial internal organs, or replacements for body parts developed by a biomedical engineer. The two work in tandem, but their approach is different. Biomedical Engineering has more mandatory courses than Biomedical Sciences.
Is Biomedical Engineering a path to become a doctor? In theory, yes, although it’s not recommended because it can be difficult to take the courses required to apply to medical school. The decision is whether you want to be a doctor or an engineer. Biomedical Sciences is a good route to becoming a doctor or other health care professional. Biomedical Engineering leads to becoming an engineer, usually in the medical field and biotechnology field.

Paging future doctors – and dentists and chiropractors and…

Aiming for a career in health care? This is the program for you.
Study human and animal systems and their functions related to health, disease, and the healing process. Diversify your knowledge by learning about viruses, bacteria, and other microbes, and how these (along with genetic and environmental influences) can impact health. Examine how the body ages, how disease and injury impact it, and what diagnostic tools can identify physiological problems.
You’ll start with foundational courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and math that prepare you to meet the admission requirements of most health-related professional schools. After first year, you’ll focus on human biology with courses in anatomy, physiology, histology, microbiology, and biochemistry. Add some complementary courses from science and related disciplines and then round out your degree with electives of your choice.
By the time you graduate, you’ll have the solid scientific foundation you need to succeed in most health care professions or to pursue specialized Master's or PhD degrees.

Common questions about the program

Will Biomedical Sciences help me get into medicine, pharmacy, optometry, or other professional schools?
This program has been designed to help students meet the academic requirements for most health-related professional schools, as well as the standardized tests that can be required for admission (such as the MCAT or OAT). As well, this major doesn’t offer co-op on purpose: to reduce the amount of time you're in your undergraduate degree so you can move onto the professional school of choice that much sooner.
Biomedical Sciences is a great program if you want to go into professional schools, but it's definitely not the only path that will get you there. Our advice is to choose a program that you'll enjoy and that has enough electives to take courses required for applying to professional programs.
Since the program doesn't offer co-op, are there ways I can get involved in research and gain other experience?
There are many ways to gain skills and build your résumé outside of the co-op program. You can pursue the EDGE certificate program which consists of online professional development courses paired with volunteer/work experiences. If you're interested in research, you can start by learning about the research that your professors are doing and contacting them about volunteer positions in their labs. Professors also have funding for full-time research in the spring (summer) term that you can apply for. There are also many volunteer and part-time work opportunities on and off-campus.
What is the difference between Biology, Biomedical Sciences, and Biochemistry?
Our Biology degree starts with a broad foundation in all aspects of the major. After first year, you can then use your many elective courses to focus on a specific aspect of biology such as plants, animals, or microbiology.
Biomedical Sciences also starts off with a fairly general first year but keeps a focus on human and animal biology. It also includes more chemistry and physics than Biology so that your science knowledge is a bit broader if you're interested in attending medical school, etc.
The Biochemistry program studies the chemical reactions in living systems so your courses will be about 60% chemistry with some biology and physics.
What’s the difference between Biomedical Sciences and Biomedical Engineering?
Biomedical Sciences is the study of life from a medical perspective. You’ll learn about the body, disease, healing processes, genetics, physiology – the knowledge of how the body works and responds to stimuli.
Biomedical Engineering applies that scientific knowledge to develop medical technology. For instance, a surgeon needs to understand biomedical science to operate on a patient – and might use laser-guided surgical devices, artificial internal organs, or replacements for body parts developed by a biomedical engineer. The two work in tandem, but their approach is different.
What is the difference between Biomedical Sciences and Health Sciences?
Both Health Sciences and Biomedical Sciences are extremely flexible and can help you achieve your goals in health care and medical professions, such as obtaining a medical degree. Both offer foundational science courses in first year, such as cell biology, chemistry, and human physiology. Both offer a Bachelor of Science degree.
The difference is most noticeable after first year. Health Sciences courses combine topics like life sciences, social sciences, and research and apply those concepts to important health care subjects such as epidemiology and health informatics. Biomedical Sciences focuses on more traditional medical-based science, such as organic chemistry and molecular biology. Biomedical Sciences offers more opportunities to get into lab facilities while Health Sciences offers paid experience through our co-op program. Both will give you hands-on experience and access to award-winning instructors, so regardless of which you choose, you’ll be well prepared for your future career in health care.
Take our Biomedical Sciences vs Health Sciences quiz and see what is right for you.

Earth Sciences,https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/earth-sciences,"
Launch a career that rocks

Learn about the fascinating and complex world under your feet by exploring topics such as geology, geophysics, geochemistry, and hydrogeology.
In its four-billion-year-old history, the Earth has changed – sometimes slowly (such as mountain building) and sometimes with violent and sudden transformations that can be devastating (such as a meteorite impact). In Earth Sciences you'll learn about the make up of our planet, from rocks and soil to water and the effects of climate change. We depend upon resources that come from the Earth, such as minerals, oil, organic materials, gases, and the water we drink. Who finds these hidden and valuable resources? A geoscientist!
Dig deep with your choice of specialization: Geology, Geophysics, or Hydrogeology. And if you're up for it, apply your knowledge through the paid work experiences co-op offers.
When you graduate, you’ll be eligible for a Professional Geoscientist designation — and be ready to develop meaningful environmental protection plans, predict natural disasters, advance health standards for water, and more.
Program highlights
Get career-relevant skills. Right from your first term, you’ll gain practical experience in our advanced lab facilities. Or take part in research: our professors run projects in 15 countries on five continents.
Meet other geo-geeks. Build bonds outside the lab and lecture hall. The Earth and Environmental Science club (WATROX) regularly organizes field trips, social activities, and other events.
Available as a regular and co-op program 
Available as a major and minor
Graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Earth Sciences
Offered through the Faculty of Science
Watch video on YouTube
In addition to interesting labs and field work, you can also benefit from 20 months of paid co-op work experience and graduate ready for a career as an exploration geologist, groundwater specialist, environmental geochemist, consultant, teacher, and more.
What will you learn?

First-year courses
In your first year, you'll take a mixture of Earth Sciences, Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics courses to give you the foundations for your upper-year classes. After first year, most of your classes will be Earth Sciences courses.

Common questions about the Health Sciences program

How is Waterloo’s Health Sciences program different from similar programs at other universities?
In addition to learning how to treat disease, Waterloo’s Health Sciences program also focuses on disease prevention, enabling you to develop effective approaches that keep people healthy. You’ll learn to take a systems approach to disease prevention and treatment, so you can understand how to influence the many factors that affect health. As a graduate, you’ll be well-prepared for the health-care careers of the future because you’ll be exposed to subjects that will grow increasingly important over the next decade, such as leveraging information technology, understanding the aging population, mental health, and more.
With many small class opportunities like labs and tutorials, over 40 health-related courses to choose from, and experiential learning opportunities like co-op and our EDGE certificate program, you’ll have a distinct advantage when entering the workforce or applying to further studies.
What is the difference between Health Sciences and Biomedical Sciences?
Both Health Sciences and Biomedical Sciences are extremely flexible and can help you achieve your goals in health care and medical professions, such as obtaining a medical degree. Both offer foundational science courses in first year, such as cell biology, chemistry, and human physiology. Both offer a Bachelor of Science degree.
The difference is most noticeable after first year. Health Sciences courses combine topics like life sciences, social sciences, and research and apply those concepts to important health care subjects such as epidemiology and health informatics. Biomedical Sciences focuses on more traditional medical-based science, such as organic chemistry and molecular biology. Biomedical Sciences offers more opportunities to get into lab facilities while Health Sciences offers paid experience through our co-op program. Both will give you hands-on experience and access to award-winning instructors, so regardless of which you choose, you’ll be well prepared for your future career in health care.
Does this program meet the prerequisites for medical school and the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT)?
This is a popular option if you plan to pursue medicine. If you’re interested in a future clinical health profession, you should consult the requirements of the schools you want to attend. Between your required and elective courses in the program, you’ll be able to meet the requirements for most medical schools in Canada and around the world. Read our tips on how to get into medical school.
What is the difference between life sciences and health sciences?
In general, a health sciences degree program, such as Health Sciences, focuses on human health whereas a life sciences degree focuses on all living things. Learn more about our health sciences and life sciences programs.
Is this program available online?
No. While you may be able to take some courses online, most courses required for the degree are available through in-person classes only.
How long does it take to complete this program?
It takes four years to complete this program as a full-time student through the regular system of study. You’ll take courses between September and April each year and have your summers off. You can also choose the co-op system of study where you’ll alternate between four-month school terms and four-month terms in full-time jobs relating to the program. A co-op program takes five years to complete – and you’ll graduate with 20 months of paid work experience.


""This program taught me how to look beyond the individual and examine the broader forces and structures in our society that impact human health. It's a perspective that helps me to be more understanding of my patients and has made me a better doctor.""Brendan, Health Sciences graduate""My favourite part of the program is the variety of disciplines and subject areas. I've learned about health from a biological, social science, ecological, and public health lens, really opening my eyes to the opportunities available in this field!""Christina, fourth-year student (minor in Gerontology)""Being in co-op, I've learned so much about careers in health and what I value when looking for a job. But most important, my confidence in interviewing for a job and performing well in the workplace has increased so much over my work terms.""Anna, third-year student""The best part about being a Waterloo student is having diverse opportunities to customize my degree. Through countless clubs and student societies, you can find your niche and community, which is incredibly supportive and open to helping other students!""Xenia, fourth-year student (minor in Psychology)

Honours Arts,https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/honours-arts,"
 Pursue your passions. Postpone the commitment.

The flexibility of Waterloo's Honours Arts program – along with a first-year course in public speaking and a love for Lord of the Rings – led Stavros to a double major in Communication Studies and Medieval Studies.
If you have a wide variety of interests, Honours Arts gives you the freedom to explore them.
In Waterloo's largest and most flexible first-year program, you’ll use your first two terms to test the waters. Sample courses from the humanities, social sciences, fine and performing arts, and languages and cultures. Discover subjects you weren’t exposed to in high school, or delve deeper into your favourite subject at the university level.
Whatever direction you end up taking, Honours Arts will give you the critical thinking skills to analyze issues, make persuasive arguments, write well, and speak with conviction — skills that will serve you well along any career path.
You can also co-register and complete your Waterloo degree through St. Jerome's University or Renison University College, smaller academic communities located on campus.
Program highlights
Choose from 30 majors. At the end of first year, it’s your choice. Pick one (or two!) of 30 different Arts majors. And then you can easily combine majors and minors to customize your degree to your interests.
Use paid co-op work terms to explore potential career areas, gain valuable work experience, and earn money to help pay for school.
Room for extracurriculars. Honours Arts gives you plenty of time outside the classroom to join clubs, run for student government, study abroad, volunteer, or explore other interests.

With thousands of employers hiring Waterloo co-op students each year, you can explore careers by applying to jobs related to your major. It's a great way to get relevant experience, make connections with potential future employers, and identify careers you might like to pursue.
Co-op is also available with any of our majors!



What's the difference between Honours Arts and Honours Arts and Business?

Most of the requirements are similar, however, Honours Arts and Business requires 14 business courses, which means less time for electives. Watch this video for more details on both programs.

Common questions about the program

Can I change my major after I apply? Can I do a double major? 
When you apply to Waterloo, you'll indicate a major that you'd like to pursue. (A major is the subject you'd like to be the focus of your degree.) You’re not committed to this major – and you don’t need to solidify the major(s) you want to explore in first year until June, which is when you'll select courses for the term starting in September. You’ll begin your major in first year even though you don’t officially choose it until the end of first year. We recommend that you explore two majors in first year to keep your options open.
			 
			You can definitely do a double major as an Honours Arts student. You could also do a minor. Not sure what a major or minor are? Check out our guide to university terminology. Advisors in the Faculty of Arts will be able to help you with choosing courses and potential majors. 
Can I switch to co-op if I change my mind?
If you’re even slightly interested in including co-op work terms as part of your degree, you should apply to co-op when you apply to Waterloo. You’ll automatically be considered for the regular system of study if you aren’t accepted for co-op, but the admission ranges are often very similar between the two systems of study. If you’re in good academic standing it is possible to switch into co-op later in your studies, but it's not guaranteed as decisions are based on how many spaces are available in co-op and how far through your degree you are. 



Admission requirements
Ontario students: six Grade 12 U and/or M courses including
Any Grade 12 U English (minimum final grade of 70% is required)
Grade 12 Calculus and Vectors is recommended if you plan to major in Economics.
Grade 12 Mathematics of Data Management is recommended if you plan to major in Political Science; Psychology; Sexuality, Marriage, and Family Studies; Social Development Studies; or Sociology.
Admission average: Low 80s

Common questions about the program

What’s the difference between Kinesiology and similar programs at other universities?
Waterloo’s Kinesiology program is a Bachelor of Science (BSc), which means that you’ll study the science behind how the human body works. As a Kinesiology student, you’ll apply your classroom learning in our many state-of-the-art labs and have over 70 Kinesiology courses and labs to choose from, ranging from anatomy to sport injury to neuroscience. In addition to labs, you can pursue additional experiential learning opportunities like co-op and our EDGE certificate program, giving you a distinct advantage as you start your career or pursue further education.
Does this program meet the prerequisites for medical school and the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT)?
Waterloo Kinesiology is a popular option if you plan to pursue medicine. If you’re interested in a future clinical health profession, you should consult the requirements of the schools you want to attend. Between your required and elective courses, you’ll be able to meet the requirements for most medical schools in Canada and around the world. View tips on how to get into medical school.
How does Kinesiology compare to Health Sciences programs?
Waterloo’s Kinesiology program is a Bachelor of Science degree focused on understanding how the body functions. In this program, you’ll focus on anatomy, biomechanics, physiology, nutrition, neuroscience, and social science. Health Sciences programs may have some similar foundational science courses but tend to focus more on population health and disease prevention rather than how the body functions.
If I do the Human Nutrition minor, can I become a dietitian?
The Human Nutrition minor is excellent preparation if you want advanced knowledge in cellular metabolism and physiological responses to nutrients, the impact of diet on chronic disease risk, and examinations of food choices in populations. However, this minor is not a direct pathway to becoming a Registered Dietitian in Canada.
Do I need to be physically active to be in this program?
Absolutely not. Waterloo’s Kinesiology program is a science-based program, so you only need to be academically strong to succeed. You’ll participate in labs where fitness assessments may be performed as part of some assessments, but students with diverse ranges of physical activity are able to participate.
What is the difference between life sciences and health sciences?
In general, a health sciences degree program, such as a Bachelor in Kinesiology degree, focuses on human health whereas a life sciences degree focuses on all living things. Learn more about our Health Sciences and Life Sciences programs.
How long does it take to complete this program?
It takes four years to complete this program as a full-time student through the regular system of study in which you’ll take courses between September and April each year and have your summers off. You can also choose the co-op system of study where you’ll alternate between full-time studies and full-time jobs relating to your program. A co-op program takes five years to complete – and you’ll graduate with nearly two years of paid work experience.
Is this program available online?
No. While you may be able to take some courses online, most courses required for the Kinesiology degree are available through in-person classes only.


""Kinesiology was the perfect preparation for my career as a physiotherapist. The variety of courses and learning opportunities is incredible. This helped me explore so many things and gave me a well-rounded understanding of the human body.""Surabhi, Kinesiology graduate""The best thing about my program is hands-on learning. Labs teach you to apply your knowledge and develop practical skills. Professors involve students in research through co-op and volunteer positions – an amazing way to learn from passionate mentors""Vanessa, fourth-year Kinesiology student""The program's strength is its multidisciplinary nature. By integrating physiology, anatomy, biomechanics, neuroscience, nutrition, and psychology, you get a comprehensive view of human health. You'll join a community focused on promoting healthy living.""Nathania, fourth-year Kinesiology student""There are so many opportunities for hands-on experience outside the classroom! You can dissect human cadavers, volunteer in research labs, or work with varsity athletes. My volunteer experiences were invaluable, and I made great friends along the way!""Emily, third-year Kinesiology student

Common questions about the program

What is the difference between Management Engineering and a business program? 
In a typical business degree program, you concentrate more on business functions such as accounting, finance, sales, human resources, and marketing and earn credits to qualify for professional designations such as Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA). 
In contrast, Management Engineering provides more focus and greater depth in engineering design, science, and mathematics and deals with identifying and solving the problems that organizations face when deciding how to make better products and services how to run the business more efficiently and effectively. As a Management Engineering graduate, you’ll be eligible to apply for a professional engineering (PEng) designation. 
Nevertheless, you’ll take a number of courses – required and electives – that may traditionally be found in business programs, covering topics such as economics, finance, organizational behaviour and design, management of technology, and entrepreneurship. 
What is the difference between Management Engineering and Software Engineering? 
Software Engineering applies computer science and engineering to design software systems. You’ll take lots of computer science and computer engineering courses at the interface of digital hardware and software, as well as core software engineering courses on software development. 
In contrast, management engineers design, implement, and manage complex management systems. Increasingly, those management systems are implemented as software and information systems. Therefore, information/software systems design comprises a major theme area in Management Engineering, with a number of courses in computer science, software engineering, and information systems. 
As a Management Engineering student, you’ll learn to solve large real-world problems of businesses and organizations that are implemented in software. As a Software Engineering student, you’ll earn to solve a wide range of software problems including low-level systems programming. 
What is the difference between Management Engineering and Industrial Engineering? 
According to the Institute for Industrial and Systems Engineers, industrial engineers design processes and systems that improve quality and productivity by eliminating waste of time, money, materials, energy, or other commodities. There are some similarities between management and industrial engineering programs, including a significant overlap in the type of courses in the two programs. In fact, management engineering could be considered a contemporary industrial engineering program. 
While the Management Engineering curriculum has a large overlap with many industrial engineering programs at other universities, there are two main differences.
Industrial engineering programs vary in the extent to which they include information/software systems design. Waterloo’s Management Engineering program has a very strong information/software systems component, with perhaps the largest concentration of such courses than most industrial engineering programs in Canada. 
Where industrial engineering has traditionally focused on the application of engineering methods to improve manufacturing and industry-related processes, management engineering broadens that focus to include other domains such as finance, business intelligence, health care, and information management. 
Do I take classes with students from other engineering programs? 
In general, you’ll likely be with the same students for most courses throughout the program. Usually, we’re able to schedule all of the Management Engineering students to be in the same classes. In later years, as you begin to take electives, you’ll likely find yourself in classes with students from other engineering programs. 
What is the ratio of males to females in the program? 
Each cohort of students is different, but females typically make up 40-50% of the students in Management Engineering. The first-year Management Engineering class in 2019 was about 46% female.

Common questions about the program

What's the difference between Mathematical Physics in the Faculty of Science and the Faculty of Mathematics?
In first year, students in the Faculty of Science will take more science courses and labs in subjects like chemistry, while students in the Faculty of Mathematics will take more computer science courses. After first year, the programs have very similar requirements and offer the same opportunities, so the biggest difference is whether you prefer to graduate with a Bachelor of Mathematics or a Bachelor of Science. There's no right or wrong degree, it's personal preference.
How do the math courses compare to high school?
The math courses in Mathematical Physics are more focused on proving a theory or problem rather than computing or defining a specific answer. This type of math may be very different than your high school math. You may find the math similar to trigonometric identities problems.

Minors and specializations,https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/minors,"
Interested in math and music? Biology and geography? Chemistry and Spanish? Many programs at Waterloo allow you to combine your interests and to make your degree uniquely you.
Including a minor (or minors) as part of your degree provides additional knowledge or skills. A minor is a group of 8-10 courses in a specific subject or topic which you would complete along with your major as part of the 40 or so courses for your degree.

How do I choose a minor?
As long as you meet the requirements, you can choose minors that complement your major – or choose minors that are very different.
Most minors and specializations start in second year and become part of your degree. For example, you can earn a Bachelor of Arts in Honours Anthropology with a minor in Political Science.


University terminology
What's a major? What's the difference between an option and a specialization? Check out our guide to university terminology.

Minors for all Waterloo students
The following minors are available to all undergraduate students regardless of which program you're studying. Programs with a high number of required courses (such as Engineering) usually do not have enough elective courses in order to include a minor, diploma, or certificate.
In addition, many Waterloo programs and faculties also have specializations specifically for students in those areas.

Arts, humanities, social science


Anthropology: From Neanderthals to Millennials, discover what it means to be human. Explore cultures past and present and delve into the origins of human and primate evolution.
Applied Language Studies: Language. We use it, learn it, and experience it every day. This is a great choice if you’re interested in learning a foreign language, teaching a second language, or in linguistics.
Canadian Politics and Public Policy: Immerse yourself with knowledge of the structure and functions of Canadian political institutions, as well as skills in policy research and analysis.
Catholic Studies: Connect the dots between how religious history intersects with different parts of society. Focus on world religions; Christian traditions; or religion, culture, and society.
Classical Studies: Explore the rich art, literature, and cultural history of the ancient civilizations of Greek and Rome.
Communication Studies: Hone your written and oral communication skills while developing expertise in teamwork, research, visual and digital literacy, and critical analysis — just the kind of skills that employers are hungry for.

Nursing,https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/programs/nursing,"
Although Waterloo does not offer a nursing program, you can pursue a career in nursing after completing as little as two years of your Waterloo degree by applying to accelerated nursing programs. These programs can take as little as 20 months to finish instead of the four years of a regular nursing degree.
If you're interested in careers in areas such as medicine, nursing, optometry, physiotherapy, or pharmacy, several Waterloo programs are great preparation.

Kinesiology

 
A graduate offers her advice
Lauryanne Bolland comes from a family of nurses, but it was her Waterloo co-op experiences working alongside various health care professionals that solidified the idea to pursue a career in nursing.
After graduating from Waterloo's Kinesiology program, Lauryanne completed an accelerated nursing program at Queen’s University. (An accelerated nursing program takes less time to complete because students already have completed at least two years of university studies).
Lauryanne works at Sunnybrook Health Science Centre in Toronto on the surgical oncology floor, where she helps head and neck, urology, and general surgery patients.
What are the benefits of an accelerated nursing program?

One benefit is that your courses are solely made up of core nursing skills and theories that are consolidated during nursing placements. When I graduated nursing school and entered into my first job, I felt as though all my learning was fresh and accessible.


Another benefit is the smaller class size. At Queen's University, my program was approximately 40 students and we were all friends. We all studied together, celebrated together after exams, and were there for each other when we had a tough day at the hospital.

 

My time at Waterloo was a really important step in my own growth. I think if I went directly into nursing out of high school I would have spent a lot of time trying to figure out what it means to be an adult and missed out on some valuable learning.

What are the disadvantages of doing a degree before nursing school?
The obvious con is the fact that it took me longer to get started in my nursing career. It took me six years to become a nurse versus four years for those that knew what they wanted to do in high school. While it would definitely be nice to be established in my nursing career, looking back I wouldn’t change a thing.
Nursing requires a lot of maturity. I was able to take the time in my Kinesiology degree to try out new things and really think about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Co-op terms at Waterloo gave me the opportunity to see what it means to be a professional, while exposing me to different career routes. In co-op I developed my own work ethic and gained some valuable life experience. All of this learning and growth gave me confidence entering into nursing school and motivated me to learn the most that I could during my studies.

Nursing requires a lot of emotional maturity, it is not an easy job to be the person holding someone’s hand at the end of their life. For me, entering nursing a little later provided me the capacity to cope with the challenging and emotionally exhausting aspects of the job.

What's the difference between Physics, Mathematical Physics, and Physics and Astronomy?

In Mathematical Physics, you'll take more math courses and will not be required to do labs after first year so this program is good if you’re interested in theoretical (math-based) physics. In Physics and Astronomy, you’ll have observational astronomy labs, astronomy courses such as Stars and Galaxies, and have fewer required math courses. This program is good if you’re interested in the observational side of space research. Physics continues with labs throughout the degree and is the most general physics program. It's good if you’re interested in experimental or applied physics or if you're unsure where your interests lie in physics.

Common questions about the program

What's the difference between astronomy and astrophysics? Which of the two does the program focus on?
Astronomy is more about observational physics: what you can see and observe within an entity (including our vast universe). Astrophysics uses observational physics to propose new theories and tests them through mathematical modelling. In Physics and Astronomy, you'll learn both but will focus more on observational physics.
What kind of things do you do in the astronomy labs? Do you use the observatory?
You'll use telescopes, star maps, and other instruments in your astronomy labs, and yes, one lab does use the observatory, which you can also use when it's open to the public.

How does Psychology in Science differ from Psychology through the Faculty of Arts?

The first and most obvious difference is the degree you will obtain! If choose Psychology through the Faculty of Science, you'll graduate with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) versus a Bachelor of Arts (BA). One degree isn't necessarily better than the other. It really comes down to whether you enjoy science. Your Psychology courses will largely be the same; however your other courses will be different.
You'll take chemistry and biology courses, labs, and other science electives alongside your Psychology courses. If you enjoy science, you'll enjoy psychology in the Faculty of Science. In the Bachelor of Arts program, most of your electives will be in subjects offered by the Faculty of Arts.
Both options offer the opportunity to include paid co-op work terms as part of your degree.


""The best thing about my program is the variety of courses and the flexibility I have. Co-op has shown me that I don't necessarily have to go into a professional school or pursue a master's degree. My options are a lot more open than I thought they were.""Jerika, third-year Psychology student (minor in Biology)

Common questions about the program

What’s the difference between Public Health and similar programs at other universities? 
Waterloo’s program takes a systems approach to disease prevention and treatment, so you can understand how to influence the many factors that affect health. As a Public Health student, you’ll be well-prepared for health care careers in the future because you’ll be exposed to subjects that will grow increasingly important over time, such as leveraging information technology, understanding the aging population, mental health, and more. With many small class opportunities like labs and tutorials, over 40 health-related courses to choose from, and experiential learning opportunities like co-op and our EDGE certificate program, you’ll have a distinct advantage when entering the workforce or applying to further studies. 
Should I take this program if I’m interested in pursuing medical school or another clinical health profession? 
While you may use Public Health as a stepping stone to clinical health professions such as medicine, there are very few required science courses so it isn’t designed to be a preparatory program for clinical health professions. Instead, you’ll focus on understanding systemic barriers affecting health such as socioeconomic status and apply this knowledge to prevent disease within communities. If you’re interested in public health and clinical health professions, you should consider Health Sciences. 
Does this program lead to a career as an Environmental Public Health Professional (EPHP) or Public Health Inspector? 
While this program is excellent preparation for a range of careers in health care, government and social services, and health technology, it is not an accredited EPHP program. 
Is this program available online? 
No. While you may be able to take some courses online, most courses required for the degree are available through in-person classes only. 
How long does it take to complete this program? 
It takes four years to complete this program as a full-time student through the regular system of study in which you’ll take courses between September and April each year and have your summers off. You can also choose the co-op system of study where you’ll alternate between full-time studies and full-time jobs relating to your program. A co-op program takes five years to complete – and you’ll graduate with nearly two years of paid work experience. 




""As a Public Health student, I focus on population health and the social determinants of health. However, I also get to explore epidemiology, health research, and more! The wide variety of courses has helped me figure out which topics interest me most.""Jason, Public Health student""The best thing about being a Waterloo student is meeting other students. There are many clubs and intramurals you can join with friends or individually – you can meet so many people and make friends with those who have similar interests.""Minah, third-year Public Health student""I'm proud to be a Waterloo student! The world-renowned co-op program exposes you to various jobs, letting you explore your interests. Co-op has also helped me learn about public health by giving me relevant skills I wouldn't learn in a classroom.""Serrina, third-year Public Health student

Common questions about the program

What’s the difference between Recreation and Leisure Studies and similar programs at other universities and colleges?
Waterloo was the first university in Canada to have a Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies and we continue to have a strong reputation among employers. Our program’s multidisciplinary approach will prepare you for careers in a variety of settings from community to not-for-profit to professional organizations. With over 40 recreation-related courses, flexibility in electives, and experiential learning opportunities like co-op and our EDGE certificate program, you’ll have a distinct advantage when pursuing your careers or further education.
What’s the difference between a college diploma and a university degree in recreation?
Entry-level careers might be similar for diploma and degree holders, but many diploma holders eventually pursue a degree in order to expand their career options. While a degree usually takes longer to complete, it usually covers more theoretical knowledge that can help you create and adapt to major changes in the industry. Having an undergraduate degree also means that you can more easily pursue further education such as a Master’s degree that can expand career options even further.
How long does it take to complete this program?
It takes four years to complete this program as a full-time student through the regular system of study in which you’ll take courses between September and April each year and have your summers off.
You can also choose the co-op system of study where you’ll alternate between full-time studies and full-time jobs relating to your program. A co-op program takes five years to complete – and you’ll graduate with nearly two years of paid work experience.
It could also be completed over a longer period as a part-time program.
Is this program available online?
No. While you may be able to take some courses online, most courses required for the degree are available through in-person classes only.

Common questions about the program

What’s the difference between this program and sport management or sport administration programs at other universities?
While there are always subtle differences between similar programs at different universities, Waterloo’s program is comparable to programs called Sport Management or Sport Administration at other universities and can lead to similar careers. However, in addition to learning about how to apply business skills in community and professional sport settings, you’ll also learn about the broader recreation industry, opening doors to additional career options. Plus you'll have the advantage of exploring careers and gain relevant work experience through North America's largest co-op program or the EDGE certificate program for students not in co-op.
Is this program available online?
No. While you may be able to take some courses online, most courses required for the degree are available through in-person classes only.
How long does it take to complete this program?
It takes four years to complete this program as a full-time student through the regular system of study in which you’ll take courses between September and April each year and have your summers off.
You can also choose the co-op system of study where you’ll alternate between full-time studies and full-time jobs relating to your program. A co-op program takes five years to complete – and you’ll graduate with nearly two years of paid work experience.
You can complete over a longer period as a part-time program.


""We have the best professors who care about you and what your interests are beyond the classroom. I’m grateful for the office hour chats and advice they gave me over the years; I regularly leverage the different techniques I learned in class in my job.""Katie, fifth-year Recreation and Sport Business student (co-op)""Every university experience is different, but if you want to make the most out of your time here at Waterloo, make sure that you get involved! There are so many things that you can do on campus that can make your experience here so great!""Lauren, second-year Recreation and Sport Business student""Going into the community and getting to experience and see first-hand the impact recreation and leisure has on people’s lives is incredible. On campus, it's comforting to have approachable professors who are always willing to help students.""Sarah, fourth-year Recreation and Sport Business student""My co-op position turned into a full-time job! Now, I'm the General Manager of an athletics facility. It requires a number of different skills. I’m confident the things I learned in class are what prepared me to be successful in this field.""Bryce, Recreation and Sport Business graduate

Become a professional change maker.
Do you have a passion for social justice? Do you feel a calling to help others and create change? With a Bachelor of Social Work (BSW), you'll empower individuals, families, groups, and communities to sustain and improve their quality of life.
Our 10-month BSW program lays the foundation for generalist practice in a range of social service, health, and community settings. The theories, approaches, and skills developed through your BSW degree coursework will ensure your strong ability to use a social justice lens for assessment, intervention, advocacy, and social action purposes.
In the Social Work program, you'll have the opportunity to integrate your learning through a field placement. Field placements provide relevant foundational skills to move forward in the profession. Some areas of field placement experiences include (but are not limited to)
child welfare,
community mental health and addictions,
working with 2SLGBTQIA+ and BIPOC communities, and
working with persons with disabilities.

In high school?
If you're considering pursuing a BSW degree, you can prepare for this program by first completing a Social Development Studies (SDS) degree or another undergraduate degree as long as you meet the prerequisites.


College or university student elsewhere?
You can apply as a transfer student or through the Social Service Worker pathway. If you already have a BA, you just need to have completed the prerequisites, which can be done as part of SDS or another BA. If you have questions, please connect with an academic advisor.

Access to advanced-standing MSW degree. As a graduate of the BSW program, you're eligible to apply for an advanced-standing Master of Social Work (MSW) program. Get an advanced degree in as little as a year, rather than two.

What if I have not yet completed my bachelor's degree?

SDS is an excellent way to build your understanding of social work and ensure you have the seven prerequisite courses before applying to the BSW program.
Applicants to the BSW program must have a Bachelor of Arts degree of equivalent to be eligible to begin the program. If you're completing your degree at the time of application to the BSW, you may be eligible for a conditional offer of admission. 



Can I apply with a Social Service Worker diploma and receive transfer credits?

Applicants to the BSW program must have completed a Bachelor of Arts degree or equivalent to be eligible to begin the program. If you have a Social Service Worker diploma, you can apply to the BSW through our Social Service Worker Pathway. If you're accepted into the pathway, you'll receive transfer credits into the Bachelor of Arts Social Development Studies (SDS) program to fast-track your completion of an undergraduate degree. As part of your pathway acceptance, you will also receive a conditional offer to the BSW, which begins after your SDS degree is complete.



Do I have to do Social Development Studies at Waterloo first?
No. Applicants to the BSW program must have completed a Bachelor of Arts degree or equivalent to be eligible to begin the program, but it does not have to be an SDS degree. Many students, however, do choose to pursue an SDS degree to complete prerequisite courses.


What if I have a degree but I'm missing prerequisites?

If you have completed an undergraduate degree but are missing one or more prerequisites, you can complete those courses during the application process. If you have completed a minimum of 4 prerequisites and/or you are registered for them at the time of application, you may receive a conditional offer to the BSW.



What are the prerequisites for BSW?

Here are the 7 prerequisites to the BSW program.



Can I complete my BSW online?

The full-time BSW is in-person, on-campus. The part-time BSW is offered as blended learning; courses are primarily online, however, there may be one or two in-person classes on campus per semester.



What can you do with a BSW degree?

A BSW is a professional degree which is required for many social work careers and related professions. We see our graduates working forward in a variety of career areas, including
child welfare
community mental health and addiction
housing support
settlement services
youth services
2SLGBTQIA+
Black, Indigenous, and people of colour
persons with disabilities



Can I pursue further education?

Graduates from the BSW program often pursue Master of Social Work degrees or further education in related areas (e.g. public health, law). Once you have completed a BSW degree, you are eligible to apply for advanced-standing MSW programs, including the Waterloo MSW program housed right at Renison's School of Social Work.



How long does the BSW take?

Full-time students in the BSW program can expect to complete their degree in as little as 10 months. Part-time students complete the BSW program within three years.


""The Bachelor of Social Work arms me for my decolonizing work in the sense that it supported me to think critically moving into the field and challenged me to shape, reshape, and then reshape again, the way that I saw things or harness the lense that I'm Akeisha, BSW '15""I remember the campus, the professors, and the friends I made. It really was a memorable program educationally and socially. I have and still am utilizing and implementing a lot of the learning that came from this experience.""Martha, BSW '17, MSW '18 "

Common questions about the program

What do recreation therapists actually do?
While this program can lead to a range of careers, many graduates choose to work as recreation therapists. Recreation therapists ""use recreation, leisure, and play as treatment modalities to support purposeful and meaningful interventions that are based on individual strengths and values, and are guided by assessments."" (Canadian Therapeutic Recreation Association)
What’s the difference between Therapeutic Recreation and similar programs at other universities?
Waterloo’s program includes an overview of the entire recreation and leisure sector and has developed a solid reputation amongst employers. We work with a large network of organizations for our 105-hour practicum and 560-hour internship requirements, and with additional experiential learning opportunities like co-op and our EDGE certificate program, you’ll have a distinct advantage when applying to careers or further studies.
As a Waterloo graduate, you can also be eligible for registration with Therapeutic Recreation Ontario (TRO) and certification with the National Council for Therapeutic Recreation Certification (NCTRC).
What’s the difference between a diploma and a degree in Therapeutic Recreation?
According to the Canadian Therapeutic Recreation Association, ""recreation therapists need a bachelor’s degree, usually in a recreation therapy or related field such as recreation and leisure studies with an emphasis or concentration in recreational therapy/therapeutic recreation. The bachelor’s degree program usually includes the following programs along with an internship: assessment, foundations, interventions, human anatomy, psychology, and courses on specific demographics.""
How long does it take to complete this program?
It takes four years to complete this program as a full-time student through the regular system of study in which you’ll take courses between September and April each year and have your summers off.
You can also choose the co-op system of study where you’ll alternate between full-time studies and full-time jobs relating to your program. A co-op program takes five years to complete – and you’ll graduate with nearly two years of paid work experience.
It could also be completed over a longer period as a part-time program.
Is this program available online?
No. While you may be able to take some courses online, most courses required for the degree are available through in-person classes only.




""I’m convinced my acceptances into occupational therapy post-graduate programs was due to my practicum, internship, and paid co-op work experiences in Therapeutic Recreation. These experiences were so valuable.""Esther, Therapeutic Recreation graduate""Therapeutic Recreation is really versatile and easy to customize! If you're interested in art and music or enjoy working with children or older adults, you can take courses in those areas and customize your degree based on your interests and goals.""Taryn, fourth-year Therapeutic Recreation student
